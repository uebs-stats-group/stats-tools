The resources from this website is mainly for researchers generally in the area of finance. Finance research, when combined with data, is closely related to statistics. This is especially the case when we do empirical works. As we are all researchers doing different topics in the area of finance, we find it useful to record or write down the statistical tools, including models, tests and etc., that we come up with. Therefore, this website is here to recorde those statistical tools into blogs!

We can see several tabs in the top bar of the website. Each tab corresponds to a specific topic that one of the maintainers of this website focus on. Currently, we cover **credit research**, **risk management** and **asset pricing**. Under each tab, statistical tools that are usually used for research in this topic will be available. In the **meeting schedule** tab, we will announce the information of our *discussion session*. The *discussion session* is set up to share the knowledge of the tools we blogged in a <u>seminar presentation mode</u>. To join in the *discussion session*, please fill the subscribe form by clicking the subscribe button in the home page (lower left).

Feel free to play with the materials we blogged in this website! Though we primarily do researches in the area of finance, we believe these knowledge in statistcs will also be meaningful to researchers in other fields such as accounting, marketing, operation research and so on. And we attempt to make them as general as for other business school researches. If you would like to contribute to the mateirals or maintainance of the website, more than welcome to contact us (you will find our emails in the home page as well)!
